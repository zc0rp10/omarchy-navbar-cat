// The cat's behaviour core.
//
// This file is deliberately pure: it holds no QML, touches nothing outside its
// arguments, and reads no clock of its own. `decide()` takes a snapshot of the
// world plus the cat's own carried-over state and returns what the cat should
// be doing. Everything that makes the cat feel alive is decided here, so it can
// all be tested with a fake clock — see test/brain.test.mjs.
//
// The idle behaviour is transcribed from oneko's own state machine
// (oneko.c:1107): a cat left alone sits, washes its face, scratches its head,
// yawns, and only then sleeps; any reason to move first plays a wake frame.
// Keeping that sequence is what makes this read as *the* cat rather than a
// sprite sliding around.

// How long a petted cat stays pleased.
var PET_MS = 4000

// it begins washing on the same frame as the click, which reads as the cat
// ignoring you rather than responding to you.

var POUNCE_REACH = 14
// How long the cat keeps looking after the last toast has gone. Its attention
// otherwise lasts exactly as long as the toast is on screen, because toasts do
// not all last the same time — a critical one stays until dismissed, and a cat
